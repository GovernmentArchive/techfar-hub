# Agile Team Estimator

This agile team estimator worksheet is a tool to help calculate Independent Government Cost Estimates or IGCEs for pricing out iterative development efforts. It focuses on pricing out capacity per team based on a unit of work that is defined as an iteration . Use the information below to help understand how to use the tool and the data from it.

## Pricing an Iteration

When awarding task orders for agile software development services, it becomes challenging to price out exactly how much an “end product” is going to cost. The beauty of adopting agile as a process is that it allows for continuous development focuses on team accomplishment towards delivery and not individual “man hours”, alternative methods of calculation are necessary. The most common is Story Points related to User Stories.

Below are elements of a typical agile project based on industry best practices for agile deployments.  These are factors which can be utilized in creating Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCE)’s which is based around the capacity a team can produce. 

For the use of this tool, an iteration is considered the unit of measure. The output of each iteration would be defined fully in the technical solution, but ideally it should be some working product, feature component, code, or analysis that results in production ready code or product. 

Not all factors must be used, but the strategies surrounding the important of the factors should be addressed when creating the IGCE, incentive strategy, or acquisition plan:

### Iteration Factors
- Size of Team: agile dev is categorized by small teams.
  
    *Example range: 4-12 Full Time Employees*

- Number of Teams: based on need and scaling, see team planner below.
- Type of Iterations included: This helps classify what kind of iteration is needed as sometimes design iterations need to be separated out from development only iterations- or other combinations which may require different skill sets. 

    *Example iterations: Design, Development, Discovery, Envisioning, Hybrid*

- Weeks of Iteration: agile dev is categorized by very small time frames to delivery. If an iteration is taking longer than 6 weeks to complete, there may be it might be recommended to determine if true agile best practices are being adopted.  
    
    *Example Weeks Range: 2-5 weeks*

- Period of Performance: How long is the total engagement?
    
    *Modular contracting recommends periods of 6-12 months*
    
- Incentives: Award/Incentive Fee.

## Team Planning
- Labor Category: defines what type of skill set is being estimated. Utilize the link below the Team Planner table to access the CALC tool for labor category estimates. 
- Hr Rate: how much per hour does that labor category make. Look for commercial rates or historical prices to get a baseline. 
- Hrs Per Iteration: This is specific to how many hours per the number of weeks proposed for iterations. 

    *Example: Scrum Master is required full time for 3 week iterations = total # of hours per iteration: 40x3 =120*

### Note on team planning
Not all labor categories have estimated a full time effort for every proposed category. Considerations for hours included are whether they are having staff fulfil more than one role, or that a higher paid developer may not need to be full time to be effective in the delivery of the increment. 

It is important that there is a correlation between any estimations of labor hours based on an offeror’s technical solution which discusses the methodology for the team composition. This will help evaluators determine best value and trade off. 

## Firm Fixed Price IGCE Example
The important thing to remember when pricing out firm fixed price agile software development is that, unlike waterfall contracts, it is difficult to develop a fixed price that correlates directly to the full set of released features or developed system. Instead, think of the IGCE as establishing the investment that an agency is committing to make towards the continual delivery of product. 

Under this type of task order, the deliverable is the repeated process which delivers of functional high quality product in accordance with the “Definition of Done” For that reason, the agile iteration (whether its Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.)  is the firm fixed price deliverable and what should be used as the basis for invoicing and payments.

### CLIN Structure
This is how this would look if the information was then priced out in a CLIN structure

CLIN Structure |
--------------------------------------------------------------- |
BASE PERIOD: 12 months |
CLIN 0001, FFP- Completion - The Contractor shall provide services for the Government in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS) |

Factor | Value
--------------------------------- | ---------------------
Length of Iteration | 3 Weeks 
Number of Iterations |	8 Sprints
Price Per Iteration	| $88,180
Period of Performance	| 12 months
Firm Fixed Price (Completion)	| $705,440
