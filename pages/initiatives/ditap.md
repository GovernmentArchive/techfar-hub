# Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training (DITAP)

The USDS and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) have partnered to develop a digital IT acquisition professional community (DITAP). The first component of this community is a training and certification program for contracting officers, which is currently in its second round of piloting this effort. The goal of this effort is that this development program will be offered in multiple agencies, by various training providers, or by the Federal Acquisition Institute. There is currently no open course at this time, but check back to see more information about upcoming offerings of this program.

At this time we are not accepting nominations for the new cohort. We are working with training institutions and companies to have new DITAP Development Program courses soon. Please email [techfarhub@omb.eop.gov](mailto:techfarhub@omb.eop.gov) if you are interested in getting notified as soon as courses are made available.  

## About DITAP 

Current Federal procurement practices largely do not provide the flexibility required to buy and deliver modern digital services. Meanwhile, the pace of technological change continues to accelerate while citizen demand for Federal digital services increases. To meet this demand, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) needed an immersive development & training program to enhance digital services acquisition expertise across government agencies. This program is referred to as the Digital IT Acquisition Professional Program, or DITAP.

Ultimately, the goal will be for DITAP programs to be represented by Contracting Officers, Contracting Officer Representatives, and Program/Project managers as these key roles represent the acquisition ecosystem most in need of specialized training. However, as USDS and OFPP believe in testing a concept and then scaling the success, they focused on training for Contract Specialists/Officers initially, as having informed buyers is the lynchpin to acquisition success.

## The Challenge
A Challenge was launched on Challenge.gov which you can access here called for open submissions and a prize to be paid out for a winner to design and pilot a new type of training & development program. The challenge was unique in that it was done in three stages and provided seed funding for design and piloting of the winning submissions. This was a highly successful activity as it provided the winning team to jointly build the program with digital service experts to come up with a superior training experience. 

Graduates of the program will receive the FAC-C Core-Plus Digital Service Certification, which will be added to their records in FAITAS. 

Now OFPP and USDS are working with federal training institutions and training companies to scale this program to the rest of the government.
