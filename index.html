<h2>About</h2>

<p>Waterfall development methods, complex specifications, and inflexible contracts result in government procurement cycles that do not keep pace with fast-changing technology and user needs. For government to deliver services faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality, we must adopt best practices from private industry. In the TechFAR Hub you’ll find tools, resources, and lessons for planning and executing a digital service acquisition. You will also find resources to engage with the acquisition community, where you can  ask questions and share best practices with colleagues across government. Finally, the TechFAR Hub provides easy-to-use tools and templates to get you started on your very own Digital Service Acquisition.</p>
