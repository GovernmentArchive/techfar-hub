## About 

Waterfall development methods, complex specifications, and inflexible contracts result in government procurement cycles that do not keep pace with fast-changing technology and user needs. For government to deliver services faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality, we must adopt best practices from private industry. In the TechFAR Hub you’ll find tools, resources, and lessons for planning and executing a digital service acquisition. You will also find resources to engage with the acquisition community, where you can  ask questions and share best practices with colleagues across government. Finally, the TechFAR Hub provides easy-to-use tools and templates to get you started on your very own Digital Service Acquisition.

## What's New

### 8(a) Program Digital Service Initiative

Agencies want to buy digital services but program offices are frequently frustrated by long procurement lead-times, competition requirements, and lack of adequate coaching around new implementation methods, which slows down the successful adoption of modern technology at agencies. The use of SBA’s 8(a) program can solve many of these problems. The U.S. Digital Service and the Small Business Administration have partnered on this intiative to offer some solutions that help agencies quickly buy digital services using a low-risk gateway to accelerated acquisitions and product delivery.
