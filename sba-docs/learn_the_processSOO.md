# STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: LEARN THE PROCESS
*v.1 Dec 2016*


## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this (contract/task order) is to assist (AGENCY/PROGRAM) with the learning how to implement and adopt digital service methodologies such as User Experience (UX) design thinking and agile software development, which can then be used by the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) on future software implementation or development efforts.  These services will provide the agency with the knowledge and abilities to drive towards the delivery of quality products within rapid time frames through the utilization of the industry best practices. 

 
## OUTPUTS

The resulting contract will be considered successful when the following outputs have been delivered: 

* Demonstrated cultural change necessary to indicate the requiring office will likely be successful in implementing digital service methods 
* Practical application of agency readiness via the development of a light-weight prototype, alpha version, or pilot of a system built implementing the learned digital service methods
*	Retrospective of what is necessary to continue or scale adoption  

## BACKGROUND

(Agency to provide pertinent information related to the technical landscape, end user needs, technologies in place, and so forth)

## SCOPE

The scope of this effort is limited to the following activities defined under the following functional areas: (Note: AGENCY can add or remove as necessary as long as consistent with the meeting the above outcomes) 

### Functional Area 1: Cultural Change: How to move into iterative world

Objective: Through training, coaching, and change management, (AGENCY/PROGRAM) will have a basic understanding of such concepts as; hypothesis development and testing, product vision development, discovery and user research, product roadmaps, design and agile development techniques and methods, understanding end user needs, product management, auto testing and continuous integration. 

Tasks: 

*	Conduct training and coaching necessary for various team roles to reach objective 
*	Identify which design and agile methods or techniques will be used for this effort
*	Establish and define roles and responsibilities, stakeholders, potential road blocks, and risks
*	Identify and potentially install an agile tracking tool commensurate with chosen method (i.e. JIRA, Rally, VersionOne, etc.) 

### Functional Area 2: Practical Application: Development 

Objective: (AGENCY/PROGRAM) and contractor will be able to apply the design/agile techniques learned in Functional Area 1 to develop a light-weight prototype, alpha version, or pilot of a system to start mitigating an identified agency problem

Tasks: 

*	Determine a small agency problem that is a candidate for this activity
*	Utilizing chosen methods, develop an iteration baseline 
*	Create a product vision and product roadmap
*	Utilize agile development method to write epics, user stories, acceptance criteria 
*	Design solutions toward the end user experience so that  products produced meet end user goals and measure of success as well as the strategic business objectives of the providing organization.
*	Conduct iteration retrospectives, release planning, backlog grooming, and other common activities associated with iterative design and agile methodologies
*	Test solution with end users and conduct user research activities 
*	Create and track success metrics and identify if there are possible incentives


### Functional Area 3: Retrospective: What worked, what didnâ€™t, what to do next 

*	Objective: Following the development of the MVP, the government and contractor team will conduct a project retrospective activity that analyzes data gathered during performance around goals, timeline, budget, major events, and success or failures

Tasks: 

*	Determine what activities were done that foster continuous improvement
*	Record what cultural change was achieved, what still needs to happen in the agency for additional adoption, and what resources would be necessary 
*	Determine what Return On Investment there was utilizing agile (i.e. time to market, ROI, cost savings) 
*	Provide a plan for scaling the MVP through continuous design and agile processes
