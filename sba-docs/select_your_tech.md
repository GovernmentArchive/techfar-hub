# STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: SELECT YOUR TECHNOLOGY
*v.1 Dec 2016*

## OBJECTIVE

In light of the release of the Federal Source Code Policy (https://sourcecode.cio.gov/)  and the overall desire to update and modernize technology in agencies, the objective of this (contract/task order) is to assist (AGENCY/PROGRAM) with the identification and analysis of a modern technology platform or solution that would fit in the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment to increase the successful launches of new digital service products and assist with the migration off end of life legacy systems.  

In order to achieve this goal, quality partners must be able to provide expertise to evaluate and assess the “as-is” environment, an understanding of the technical landscape for digital service solutions including IaaS, SaaS or PaaS solutions, and the ability to determine whether a viable solution could be implemented in the agency.  The completion of the scope for this contract/task order will provide information necessary in the development of an acquisition strategy for the procurement or full implementation of a new technology solution. 

## OUTPUTS

The resulting contract will be considered successful when the following outputs have been delivered: 

*	Alternatives Analysis of several modern technology platforms
*	Guided functional demos of top alternatives to determine viability
*	Retrospective to compare Alternatives Analysis to demonstration results

## BACKGROUND

(Agency to provide pertinent information related to the technical landscape, end user needs, technologies in place, and so forth)

## SCOPE

The scope of this effort is limited to the following activities defined under the following functional areas: (Note: AGENCY can add or remove as necessary as long as it is consistent with meeting the above outcomes).

### Functional Area 1: Alternatives Analysis: Assisting (AGENCY/PROGRAM) to determine which modern technologies are feasible to implement in (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment.

Objective: (AGENCY/PROGRAM) will have a deep understanding of platforms and technology tools available in the market that are most advantageous in (AGENCY/PROGRAM) technology environment. Coach (AGENCY/PROGRAM) through the process of discovering tradeoffs for alternative platform solutions, to include short and long-term implications. As an added benefit, part of this scope includes analysis required in the Federal Source Code Policy which applies to all federal agencies (with limited exceptions).

Tasks: 

*	Clearly identify of an appropriate (AGENCY/PROGRAM) problem that can be solved with a modern technology platform.
*	Analysis of opportunities, constraints, and assumptions for each technology
  *	Implications of software language options (commonality and adoption in the market place)
  *	Open architecture availability
  *	Deployment strategies (Analyze platform constraints and support)
  *	Likelihood of continuous integration
  *	Availability of pre-existing Open Source Software that meets or can be modified to meet (AGENCY/PROGRAM) needs
  *	Availability of custom-developed source code to be Open Source Software and available to the public, as referenced in the Federal Source Code Policy
  *	Impact on (AGENCY/PROGRAM) IT environment
  *	Ease to fix  when technology solution is not performing
  *	Cost models: investment, operating, support, ROI, life-cycle
  *	Security considerations
  *	Design and user experience (UX) considerations
  *	508 compliance considerations
  *	Records and legal constraints
  *	Support constraints
  *	Other customers’ satisfaction with the technology
  *	Industry best practice suggestions from technology leaders
  *	Implementation time frame implications
*	Market Intelligence Around Providers
  *	Pricing structures
  *	Vendor based considerations
  *	Adequate competition considerations
  *	Vendors’ implementation capabilities
  *	Risk of potential vendor lock-in
  *	Small business vendor opportunities
  *	Constraints of funding availability

### Functional Area 2: Practical Application: Determine viability

Objective: Contractor will facilitate live hands-on demonstrations of the highest rated alternatives using end users to interact with the recommended platform(s) The demonstrations must be performed in the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment or vendor-provided test environment to and simulate a micro-version of the platform or solution with some of the  needed functionality to verify usefulness(AGENCY/PROGRAM). Demonstrations should reduce (AGENCY/PROGRAM) time and cost, while improving and increasing user involvement.

Tasks: 

* Obtain or establish a method to demonstrate in real time the highest rated results from the Alternatives Analysis, in order to use those technologies on a non-production or low risk version of the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment
*	Verify the utility of the platform by testing with end users, including those who would use the end products, administer, or manage them
*	Evaluate and document how the solutions met end user goals as a measure of success, as well as, strategic business objectives of the (AGENCY/PROGRAM)
*	Evaluate performance of platform/solution against criteria identified in the Alternatives Analysis


### Functional Area 3: Retrospective: What worked, what didn’t, what to do next 

Objective: Following the development of the functional prototype(s), the government and contractor team will use the results of Functional Area 2 to develop conclusions and next steps. 

Tasks: 

*	Conduct a retrospective activity that analyzes data gathered during the demo that considers project  goals, timeline, budget, events, success or failures, and the other aspects previously identified in the Alternatives Analysis.
*	Evaluate factors and constraints identified during the demo phase which were not anticipated during the Alternatives Analysis
*	Determine what roadblocks were mitigated and which ones still exist that need to be addressed. 
*	Provide a plan for scaling the most viable platform(s)/solution(s) through development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using continuous design a
