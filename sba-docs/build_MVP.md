# STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: DIGITAL MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)
*v.1 Dec 2016*
*[Read the Guide on How to Use an 8(a) for Your Digital Service Needs](/sba-docs/how_to_8a.md)* 

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this (contract/task order) is to utilize digital service techniques to identify and solve a core user need through the development and release to end users of a Digital Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  This SOO is predicated on the fact that (AGENCY/PROGRAM) stakeholders understand User Experience (UX) design thinking and/or agile software development. For example, job responsibilities within (AGENCY/PROGRAM) have been redefined according to agile and/or human-centered design roles, and stakeholders are comfortable enough with modern technology concepts and are ready to start delivery of a digital service product by developing an MVP.

In order to achieve this goal, quality partners must be able to establish and execute a framework for user centered design, usability research, and agile implementation. 

## OUTPUTS

The resulting contract will be considered successful when the following outputs have been delivered: 

*	Identification of product vision, hypothesis building and testing, user research, and success metrics
*	Build and launch of an initial digital version of the product into production, and usability research with end users to determine whether success was met
*	Determination and documentation of what is necessary to scale the solution, if successful, or a plan to pivot to a different solution if unsuccessful   

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

(AGENCY to provide concise description of the challenge that a digital service product will be implemented to solve. Ex. The front end of Agency X’s vendor invoice management is handled via fax or email, with no central or automated way of collecting data related to payment processing) 

## BACKGROUND

(Agency to provide pertinent information related to the technical landscape, end user needs, technologies in place, and so forth) 

## SCOPE

The scope of this effort is limited to the following activities defined under the following functional areas: (Note: AGENCY can add or remove as necessary as long as consistent with the meeting the above outputs) 

### Functional Area 1: Discovery and Design

Objective: (AGENCY/PROGRAM) and contractor will collaborate to determine how the problem will be solved through digitalization, utilize user centered design techniques and product management methods to create an initial product vision, product roadmap, and scope of the MVP.

Tasks: 

*	Conduct discovery to determine a digital solution to the agency problem and end user goals for this activity
*	Create hypothesis statement(s) that can be tested by the release of the MVP
*	Create a product vision and initial scope for the MVP and product roadmap

The successful solution, at a minimum, shall also include the following best practices as highlighted in the digital service playbook: 

* Understand what people need
* The contractor shall begin this digital service project by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. The vendor shall continually test the products with end users to ensure delivery is focused on meeting their needs
* In delivery of this effort the contractor shall:

  1.	Early in the project, the contractor shall spend time with current and prospective users of the service
  2.	Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors
  3.	Develop and test mock ups or prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
  4.	Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
  5.	Share findings with the team and agency leadership
  6.	Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories" to be utilized in the agile development process
  7.	During development, continuously user-test the the MVP to ensure it meets user needs

### Functional Area 2: Development of Minimum Viable Product 

Objective: Through the use of agile software development methods a minimum viable product will be developed and released to end users. 

Tasks: 

*	Utilize an agile development method to write and manage epics, user stories, acceptance criteria 
*	Conduct iteration retrospectives, release planning, backlog grooming, and other common activities associated with iterative design and agile methodologies
*	Implement best practice methods for automated testing and code reviews
*	Work with the agency to develop or manage continuous integration, code management processes, security, 508 compliance, privacy or any other agency policies that need to be incorporated in order to release the product in a live environment
*	Test solution with end users and conduct user research activities 
*	Create and track metrics to determine whether the delivered solution meets end users’ needs and solves agency problem statement to some degree. 
*	As a result of the feedback provide recommendations on what should be modified in future versions of the product

The successful solution, at a minimum, shall also include the following best practices as highlighted in the digital service playbook: 

* **Address the whole experience, from start to finish**
  
  The contractor shall ensure we need understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter — whether it's online or offline — should move the user closer towards their goal.

  In delivery of this effort the contractor shall:
    1.	Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
    2.	Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
    3.	Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
    4.	Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service

* **Make it simple and intuitive**

  Successful delivery of this contract requires that the services of and products delivered will not be stressful, confusing, or daunting. Therefore the contractor shall build and release a digital MVP that is simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

  In delivery of this effort the contractor shall:
    1.	Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the U.S. Web Design Standards as a default
    2.	Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
    3.	Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
    4.	Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
    5.	Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
    6.	Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
    7.	Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points

* **Use data to drive decisions**

  At every stage of a project, the contractor shall measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. These metrics shall be reported to the Program Managers to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.

  In delivery of this effort the contractor shall:
    1.	Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
    2.	Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)
    3.	Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs
    4.	Provide metrics which may be published internally
    5.	Provide metrics which may be published externally
    6.	Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production

### Functional Area 3: Retrospective: What worked, what didn’t, what to do next 

Objective: Following the development and release of the MVP, the government and contractor team comes together to understand from a project viewpoint to identify improvement actions. 

Tasks: 

*	Conduct a project retrospective activity that analyzes data gathered during performance around goals, timeline, budget, major events, and success or failures
*	Determine what roadblocks were mitigated and which ones still exist that need to be addressed. 
*	Provide or update the Product Roadmap for scaling the MVP through continuous design and agile processes
*	Ensure all system documentation, user stories, acceptance criteria and test scripts are finalized.
