## 8(a) Program Digital Service Initiative 

Agencies want to buy digital services but program offices are frequently frustrated by long procurement lead-times, competition requirements, and lack of adequate coaching around new implementation methods, which slows down the successful adoption of modern technology at agencies.  

The use of SBAâ€™s 8(a) program can solve many of these problems.  The 8(a) program can get requirements on contract quickly with a sole source procurement of up to $4 million dollars in value.  It also provides agencies a perfect, low-risk gateway to accelerated acquisitions and product delivery. This initiative clarifies that procuring agencies that award digital services requirements through the 8(a) Program need not request release from 8(a) competition when awarding digital service developmental iterations or add-on services.  As such, agencies are permitted to award contracts for additional development utilizing different acquisition strategies (to include non-8(a) strategies) without requesting release from 8(a) competition.
