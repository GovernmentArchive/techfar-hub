## 8(a) Program Digital Service Initiative 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) and United States Digital Service (USDS) partnered together to provide increased ability to:

1.	Give a clear, easy, and fast path to agencies to start digital services projects
2.	Entice non-traditional vendors into the Government space through the 8(a) program
3.	Increase the number of contracts awarded to quality digital service providers
4.	Reduce administration for the SBA and agencies by providing an easy on-ramp to and release from the 8(a) program for projects within scope
