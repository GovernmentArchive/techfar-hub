## How to Create a Digital Service Acquisition

Implementing a digital service acquisition can seem daunting, but the following tools, samples, templates, and resources provide a simple guide for getting started. 

### Estimation Tool

It is important to have an estimate that aligns with your agile approach. The [Agile Team Estimator](/assets/files/agile_estimator823.xlsx) helps build an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for agile development services.

### Requirement Tools

Click [Build a Solicitation](https://agile-solicitation-builder.apps.cloud.gov){:target="_blank"} to get started creating a Request for Quote (RFQ) based on the [Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov){:target="_blank"} This is still an alpha version so feedback is appreciated. All documents should be approved by a warranted contracting officer and in consultation with your legal counsel as required.

### Sources Sought Tool
Once you have determined what it is you need, you need to know where to get it. The Sources Sought tool is a Google form. If your agency allows you to use Google products, simply make a copy and send it out or post it with your RFI. If you do not have access to Google products you can use the Word version under the template section at the bottom of this page.

### 8(a) Program Digital Service Initiative 
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in collaboration with the U.S. Digital Service, is excited to announce a new tool available for use by Federal Contracting Officers to enable expeditious procurement of digital services.  This initiative allows agencies to achieve cultural change to implement Digital Service Playbook and TechFAR strategies with lowered risk, try out modern technology stacks, and begin iterative development with little to no procurement lead time.

### Acquisition Innovation Advocates (AIA) Council
The [AIA](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/AIA-March9Memo.pdf){:target="_blank"} consists of [advocates identified from each agency](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/AIA_List.pdf){:target="_blank"} subject to the [CFO Act of 1990](https://cfo.gov/about/){:target="_blank"}, as well as, an advocate from the Small Agency Council.  The council is tasked with meeting regularly to broaden awareness and foster cross-agency collaboration and innovation. Among other things, council members share the status of their IT-related activities, especially in relation to the acquisitions that govern them, and exchange information with OMB's US Digital Service, Presidential Innovation Fellows, GSA’s 18F Consulting and other innovation communities regarding successes and challenges. For more information on the AIA in your agency who can advise on/assist with innovative digital services aquisitions, please contact the council coordinator: Ursula Nkwantabisa at 202-395-6811 OR 202-881-8254 OR <UNkwantabisa@omb.eop.gov>.
