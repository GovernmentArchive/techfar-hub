## GUIDE ON HOW TO USE AN 8(a) COMPANY FOR YOUR DIGITAL SERVICE NEEDS

![Howto8aCover](https://github.com/usds/techfar-hub/blob/master/assets/img/HowtoGuideCover.jpg?raw=true)
Agencies are under pressure yet willing to utilize digital services.  Program offices are frequently frustrated by long procurement lead-times, competition requirements, and lack of adequate coaching around new implementation methods, which slows down the successful adoption of modern technology at agencies.  The use of SBAâ€™s 8(a) program can solve many of these problems.  

The Small Business Administration (SBA) and United States Digital Service (USDS) partnered together to provide increased ability to:

1.	Give a clear, easy, and fast path to agencies to start digital services projects
2.	Entice non-traditional vendors into the Government space through the 8(a) program
3.	Increase the number of contracts awarded to quality digital service providers
4.	Reduce administration for the SBA and agencies by providing an easy on-ramp to and release from the 8(a) program for projects within scope
