## Interview guide

Guidance for initial research that will provide direction for the redesign of the [TechFAR Hub](techfarhub.cio.gov). Before starting any redesign, the team will interview 5 - 8 potential users to understand their perceptions of Agile procurement and their needs / pain points when procuring software contracts.

### Research questions
_These are the questions we are trying to answer with the first round of research_   
* How much do contracting officers know about agile procurement?  
* How might we encourage the use of agile procurement practices?  
* What are the largest barriers to effective agile procurement?  
* How/where do contracting officers learn new skills?

### Primary Users
Federal contracting officers
* Contracting officers unfamiliar with the site
* Contracting officers familiar with the site / took the class / know about agile  

Contracting Officer Representative (COR) – monitor, manage and approve the work delivered by vendors on the contract

Program managers

### Secondary users 
Vendors – explain that we are creating an environment where they can do their work – dispel myth that government is not agile
Their biggest concern may be finding out how to get work

## Interview Script

### Introduction
We work with the U.S. Digital Service, a team that uses technology and design to deliver better digital services to the American people. 

We are conducting these interviews to learn about contracting officers' experience procuring technology services. You are the expert here so please tell us about your experiences honestly. Don't shy away from telling us both good and bad experiences. By better understanding your needs, we hope to develop tools that can help you procure technology more effectively. 

Is it ok to take notes during the interview? Any notes will only be used within our internal team and will not be published in any way without your consent. I will be conducting the interview while [Name] primarily takes notes.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
