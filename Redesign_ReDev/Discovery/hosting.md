#Hosting for TechFarHub

##Environment
* Currently hosted on cio.gov cloud

### Solicitation Builder
* Site is hosted on cloud.gov
* Admin access for the tool is restricted to GSA only, which prevents our engineers from directly modifying or testing the code.  All updates are achieved via pull request
* Current environment does not support updates, modifications to the tool...because of admin restrictions 


##Needs
* .5-1GB of RAM: This will support at least 100K simultaneous users of the site/solicitation
* Cloud environment that allows USDS admin access for modifications
* Small database to support collaboration of multiple users on the same solicitation
  * Must also support storage of user data and generation of documents with collected data
* Secure login for users
* Secure storage of data: Need to clarify what are security needs for collection of sensitive data (NOT PII)
