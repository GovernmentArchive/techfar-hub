# Techfar V2 Product Vision

The document explains the process the USDS acquisition team followed to re/define the product vision for the techfarhub to inform decisions for the redesign and ongoing build onf the site.

## Vision Exercise 1 (05/02 and 05/09)
- Exercise was led by a member of the team
- 12 members/stakeholders of the team participated, including members from agency teams
- Several stakeholders who participated in the exercise were apathetic to the process because of previous unfruitful attempts to rebuild techfar
- Stakeholders had varying opions on the purpose for techfar and what problem it solved
- Stakeholders were unable to come to consensus on the target group for the tool

### Result
- Product vision was not defined
- Stakeholders did not commit to additional efforts to create and manage a product with a purpose
- Retrospective performed and decision was made to conduct a subsequent vision exercise with only those stakeholders who are interested in the outcome of the techfarhub redesign

## Vision Exercise 2
