# TecfarHub V.2 Taxonomy 

## version 2.0 - in progress
Created a very simple content type taxonomy to keep consistency across the initial version.

layouts:
base - standard no styling, not used in final implementation
docs - has a left navigation and holds basic text content
landing - homepage template with hero and call outs
learning - left navigation and "cards" for individual peices of content

content types
text - using USWDS default headings and body fonts
cards - using a repeated pattern for showing content (e.g. a podcast has the same card as a external link). cards include labels for the key audiences, title, descitption, and a button or link

Taxonomy basics
grouped educational material by content type:
- cases studies - internal and exteral content, written stories of the work
- templates for deliverables
- samples of completed work
- training (links to external courses)
- field guides - USDS written guides for implementation
- podcasts (audio)
- blogs - links to external blog related to DS
- vehicles - govt availble vehucles
- policy docs (memos, policies, etc)

created a seperate bucket for custom made tools
- interactive web based tools
- interactive spreadsheets
- online forms

created a bucket for non-educational initiatives
- ongoing govt programs
- USDS sponsored training
